This tool was primarily created to find where a Sanctifying Elixir can best be used.
It can also help with artifact farming priority.

The main feature is a Roll Value calculator that uses custom weightings to show artifact strength in specific teams.
These roll values should only be compared across characters with high investment (200CV+) with balanced crit ratios.
Akasha.cv can do something similar, but there are characters without leaderboards.

Features in progress
- Rank characters by a combined value score
- Display and allow editing of custom weightings
- Color code roll values
- Maybe adjust for characters with high roll value ceilings (Hu Tao?)
- Group characters with the same artifact sets, and sets from the same domain
- Display table of off-set pieces
